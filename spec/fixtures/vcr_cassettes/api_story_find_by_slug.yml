        Ali was never shy about lauding his own balletic talents in the boxing ring,
        and this photograph shows why. His ability to move away from his opponent,
        Joe Frazier, with such grace makes Frazier\u2019s haymaker look utterly crude.
        Ali appears to be untouchable. How ironic, then, that Frazier won the contest

        Such is the power of his celebrity, the assembled crowd are jostling around

        initial attraction to this shot is, of course, the quirk of the punchbag.
        It appears semi-transparent because the photographer has used flash to trap
